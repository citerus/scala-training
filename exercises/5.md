# Exercise 5: Welcome to the Future

## Scenario

Let us look into writing a module that integrates with a separate storage component.

The Storage class in the source has the following API:

```scala
trait Storage {
  def save(account: Account): Account
  
  def findById(id: String): Option[Account]
  
  def ids: Set[String]
}
```

It can save an account to the storage, it can retrieve an account by id (returning None if
there was no match), and it can retrieve the full set of ids stored.

Each method on the storage class has a random delay, simulating network communication delays.

Our job is to write non-blocking code to access this storage. An example, also included in the source:

```scala
class Consumer(val storage: Storage = Storage()) {
  
  def accumulatedValue(id: String): Future[BigDecimal] = Future {
    val account = storage.findById(id)
    account match {
      case Some(a) => a.accumulatedValue
      case None => 0
    }
  }
}
```

Implement the following non-blocking method on the Consumer:

```scala
def increaseAccumulatedValue(id: String, amount: BigDecimal): Future[BigDecimal]
```

It should retreive the account from the storage, increase the accumulatedValue and then save
the updated account. If it found no account, create a new account and save it. 

The return value should be the new accumulated value after saving the updated account.

## Testing asynchronous computations

Scalatest has good support for testing asynch code. Use the `Eventually` trait to get the
```scala
eventually {
    ...
}
```
block which will retry the body until it succeeds or it times out (by default, timeout is 100 ms).
Use the `IntegrationPatience` trait to increase the timeout to 15 seconds.

Here is an example of a test for the method:
```scala
class ConsumerTest extends FunSuite with Matchers with Eventually with IntegrationPatience {

  test("increasing the accumulated value of an account") {
    val consumer = new Consumer()

    // Given an account with id 12345 and accumulated value 10
    consumer.storage.save(Account("12345", LocalDate.now(), 10))

    val result = consumer.increaseAccumulatedValue("12345", 20)

    eventually {
      result.value should be (Some(Success(BigDecimal(30))))
    }
  }
}
```
