# Exercise 6: Back to the Future

## Scenario

Continuing our work on the Consumer from the last exercise, let us now minimize the use of the
`Future { }` blocks. Rewrite the `accumulatedValue` and `increaseAccumulatedValue` methods of the
Consumer use composition of the Futures returned from the findById and save methods.

Hints: 
* use `map` to turn a Future[A] into Future[B]
* `flatten` can turn a Future[Future[A]] to a Future[A]
* `map` and `flatten` together can be simplified as `flatMap`

## Code skeleton

You will find code skeleton and tests in the `se.citerus.practicalscala.futures` package.
